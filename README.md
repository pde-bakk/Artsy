# Artsy
With winter holidays coming up, together with Student Activities Committee, we'd like to organize an inhouse art-themed coding contest between coalitions!!  Register as a team of 2-3 students by December 20th 23:59: https://bit.ly/artsy-coding  IMPORTANT: please note you can have only team members from your own coalition.
